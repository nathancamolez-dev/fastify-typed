# Fastify Zod Pattern

This project is a template for setting up a Fastify server with the following features:

- **Fastify with Zod Type Provider**: Utilize Zod for runtime type validation and schema definition within Fastify, enabling robust type-checking and validation.

- **Swagger UI for Documentation**: Automatically generate and serve API documentation using Swagger UI, making it easy to explore and test your API endpoints.

- **BiomeJS for Linting**: Ensure code quality and consistency with BiomeJS, a powerful linter and formatter that helps maintain clean and maintainable code.
